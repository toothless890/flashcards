***
the basic drawing functionality was taken directly from
https://dev.to/fahad_islam/python-project-a-drawing-pad-gui-3f42
***
Basic Instructions:

to make a card,
1. enter a name (I may make this just an index in the future, it doesn't do a whole lot)
2. press "New"
3. Draw your character ( colors change red orange green blue purple cyclically)
4. press "Save"
5. press "Flip" to flip the card
6. draw your description ie. meaning, pronunciations, anything else you find useful.
7. save that side
8. make a new card

to fix a mistake
currently there is no undo.
1. press clear
2. draw it again
3. 3 save

   Delete deletes a card

to start going through your cards:
It's not perfect, but i like to draw my cards on the left side, and then write my answers on the right
once i'm done, i flip and check
if you're correct, press correct
if you're incorrect press incorrect
if you're unsure/wanna just skip, pressing skip has no affect on your score!
cards get sorted based on how well you can answer them,

the average accuracy of both sides are averaged and ranked (with a little bit of a jiggle to mix them up)
then the side that you are worse at will be displayed( also has a jiggle, so you'll get both unless extremely bad at one and extremely good at the other side)

If using windows, I highly recommend compressing the /Characters/ and /Descriptions/ folders (right click > properties>general> advanced> Compress contents to save disc space) as the files it stores can bloat rather quickly. 
I'm not sure about linux and mac, but I made this for my own kanji study, and i find it unlikely anyone will just stumble across this
